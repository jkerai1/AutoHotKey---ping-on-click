# AutoHotKey---ping-on-Click
Autohotkey script to ping on shoot in call of duty warzone. Ping has been binded to right alt. note that menus require user to navigate with WASD + space instead of mouse (pending a hotkey to disable the script)


copy is for non map users

normal one is for map users so map is still usable in the old way (otherwise just ping with left/right alt in map menu)

Update:
Lol they ended up making this a perk in the game
